A social networking app for autism
Insight is an online web based solution for parents and relatives of special child’s mainly focusing towards under development countries such as Bangladesh. It is not easy for a parent or relative of a special child to be able to lead a normal life in the society, we did some survey on this topic and the result was really alarming. Most of the people said that the society makes them feel uncomfortable, such as they face a lot of troubles while searching for help for their children. It is tough for them to even find school for them.
Now let’s talk about our solution, our initial goal was to create a space for them online for any kind of help and build a social network among them where doctors will also be included for giving knowledge. They will also get a place for talking among themselves.

Technical approach:
1.	Build a social networking site
2.	Build a mobile application to make it easy to access.
Tools used:
1.	Android Studio
2.	MySql
3.	Php
Our mobile application is still under construction but our website is live on a free hosting site and also we are using the same database for both of them to make both of them a same platform.

As our application is still under construction we have a way of accessing the website through our application, but for mobile application we have implemented;
•	Sign up
•	Login
•	Newsfeed
•	Explore Website
For signup user can use mobile application and website both, the user registered through website can also login from the mobile application by using the same Email address and Password. Unfortunately as our application is not fully ready yet the user can use the application to only see the newsfeed, but through the webview the user can have full access of the project being on our application.

Usefulness:
Here the people can speak about autism openly, ask for suggestions or even give suggestion without any hesitation.  

Future Plans:
•	Complete the mobile application
•	Bring live chatting
•	Map integration
